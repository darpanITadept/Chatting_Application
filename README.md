## Overview

Welcome to the **Chatting Application** â€“ a JavaFX-based program that effortlessly connects users through a central server. This application boasts an intuitive graphical interface on both the server and client sides, making communication seamless and enjoyable.

## Getting Started

### Server Side:

1. Run the server by executing `ChattingAppServer.java`.
2. The server GUI will display comprehensive system information, including the day, time, month, date, time zone, and year.
